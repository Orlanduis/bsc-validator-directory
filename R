## What is a Validator Profile?

BNB Smart Chain validators power the blockchain network by processing transactions and signing blocks. 
Validator candidates need to get support from the delegator community to increase their total voting power. 
This repository is a place for validator candidates to give potential delegators a brief introduction to your team 
and infrastructure, and present your ecosystem contributions.

Upload your logo with file named logo.png and profile.json to previously created folder,
